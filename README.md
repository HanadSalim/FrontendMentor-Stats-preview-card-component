# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## What I learnt during this project

1. Styling with sass (Scss) feels more organised as you can nest divs
2. Using the float attribute
3. Alot of tweaking to get it as close as possible to the design
